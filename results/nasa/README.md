# CalSIMETAW / CDL Landcover Results

This directory supplies _ET_ for the complete Water Year 2015 (2014-10-01 thru 2015-09-30).  

# ```monthly.csv```

Provides summarized estimates for the _ETo_,_ET_, and _Kc_,_ETs_ for the [Island Regions]. ETo is basically the same as the CalSIMETAW values, but since some regions span multiple pixels, they are included below.

```
date,region,ET,Kc,ETo,ETs
2014-10-01,dsa,5.1,...
2014-11-01,dsa,4.3,....
```

# ```daily.csv```

Provides daily estimates for the _ETo_,_ET_, and _Kc_,_ETs_.  The format is equivalent to the monthly data.

```
date,region,ET,Kc,ETo,ETs
2014-10-01,dsa,5.1,...
2014-10-02,dsa,4.3,....
```
